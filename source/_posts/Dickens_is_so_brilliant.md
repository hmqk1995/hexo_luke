title: Dickens is so brilliant 伟大的狄更斯
======

Dickens is so brilliant a stylist, his vision of the world so idiosyncratic and yet so telling, that one might say that his subject is his unique rendering of his subject, in an echo of Rothko’s statement, “The subject of the painting is the painting”—except of course, Dickens’s great subject was nothing so subjective or so exclusionary, but as much of the world as he could render. If Dickens’s prose fiction has “defects”—excesses of melodrama, sentimentality, contrived plots, and manufactured happy endings—these are the defects of his era, which for all his greatness Dickens had not the rebellious spirit to resist; he was at heart a crowd-pleaser, a theatrical entertainer, with no interest in subverting the conventions of the novel as his great successors D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf would have; nor did he contemplate the subtle and ironic counterminings of human relations in the way of George Eliot and Thomas Hardy, who brought to the English novel an element of nuanced psychological realism not previously explored. Yet among English writers Dickens is, as he once called himself, part-jesting and part-serious, “the inimitable.”

狄更斯是一个十分伟大的文体家，他对世界的理解十分破除传统印象，并且十分生动，以至于一个人可能会说他的主题就是对他的主题的独特渲染，在一个Rothko的陈述的回应中。“绘画的主题是绘画”——当然，除了，狄更斯的伟大主题并不是这么主观和排斥，却很大程度上是对他能描绘的世界。如果说狄更斯的散文小说有什么“缺点”——过度的情节剧，多愁善感，复杂情节，以及人造的欢乐结局——这些他的时代的缺陷，在这样的时代对于他的所有伟大才能，狄更斯没有足够的反叛精神去承受；他内心是一个取悦观众的人，一个戏剧逗乐者，并没有兴趣来颠覆小说传统，像他的伟大的继任者D.H. Lawrence, James Joyce, and Virginia Woolf那样。他也不凝视细小和讽刺性的对于用George Eliot和Thomas Hardy的人类关系将计就计，这两个人将一种细微的之前没有探索过的心理真实感带入英语小说。然而在众多的英语作家中，狄更斯是，像他曾经称呼自己的一样，一半戏谑一半严肃的作家，是“不可效仿的”。
