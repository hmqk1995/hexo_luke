title: Tulip mania
======

At the peak of tulip mania in Holland, in March 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsman. It is generally considered the first recorded speculative bubble. The term "tulip mania" is now often used metaphorically to refer to any large economic bubble (when asset prices deviate from intrinsic values).

在1637年的3月的荷兰的"Tulip mania"（郁金香狂热）的顶峰，一些单个的郁金香块茎销售额比一个技术好的手艺人的年收入的10倍还要多。基本上认为是第一次记录的可推测的经济泡沫。TM这个名词现在经常被比喻性地用来形容一些大的经济泡沫（当物品价格偏离内部价值时）。

The event was popularized in 1841 by British journalist Charles Mackay. According to Mackay, at one point 12 acres of land were offered for a Semper Augustus bulb. Mackay claims that many such investors were ruined by the fall in prices, and Dutch commerce suffered a severe shock. Some modern scholars, however, feel that the mania was not quite as extraordinary as Mackay described. Some even argue that not enough price data remain, historically, to represent an all out tulip bulb bubble.

这个事件在1841年的英国杂志Charles Mackay时分流行。Charles Mackay认为，土地的1.12公亩都被用来种植Semper Augustus的块茎了。M认为许多这样的投资者都被价格的下跌毁灭，而且荷兰商业经受了一个严重的波动。然而，一些现代学者认为这种狂热没有M杂志描述的那么不一般。一些人甚至认为没有足够的历史保留的数据来表示整个郁金香块茎的泡沫。

In her 2007 scholarly analysis Tulipmania, Anne Goldgar states that the phenomenon was limited to "a fairly small group", and that most accounts from the period are based on a few contemporary pieces of propaganda. While Mackay's account held that a wide array of society was involved in the tulip trade, Goldgar's study of archived contracts found that even at its peak the trade in tulips was conducted almost exclusively by merchants and skilled craftsmen who were wealthy, but not members of the nobility. Thus, any economic fallout from the bubble was very limited. Goldgar, who identified many prominent buyers and sellers in the market, found fewer than half a dozen who experienced financial troubles in the time period, and even of these cases it is not clear that tulips were to blame. This is not altogether surprising. Although prices had risen, money had not exchanged hands between buyers and sellers. Thus profits were never realized for sellers; unless sellers had made other purchases on credit in expectation of the profits, the collapse in prices did not cause anyone to lose money.

AG在她2007年的关于Tulipmania的学术分析中强调这种显现只是被限制在“一个相当小的群体”中，而且大部分来自那个时期的报告都基于几个当时的宣传的价格。尽管M的解释认为一个广泛的社会群体呗卷进了郁金香贸易中，G对于存档的贸易合同的研究发现即使是在郁金香的贸易的顶峰，贸易也只是在大部分的的商人和精通的手艺人之间进行，这些手艺人十分富有，但不是贵族群体。因此，一些来自于泡沫的经济下跌是非常有限的。G，他研究了许多有名的在市场的买家和卖家，发现不到半打的人在这段时期经历了经济困难，而且即使在这些案例中是不是郁金香的问题也不清楚。这根本不足以惊奇。尽管价格已经上涨了，金钱还没有在买家和卖家手中进行交换。因此利益从来没有被卖家意识到；除非卖家为了期待这些利益，通过信用进行了其他购买途径，这个价格灾难不会对任何人造成财产损失。

There is no dispute that prices for tulip bulb contracts rose and then fell in 1636–37, but even a dramatic rise and fall in prices does not necessarily mean that an economic or speculative bubble developed and then burst. For tulip mania to have qualified as an economic bubble, the price of tulip bulbs would need to have become unhinged from the intrinsic value of the bulbs. Modern economists have advanced several possible reasons for why the rise and fall in prices may not have constituted a bubble. For one, the increases of the 1630s corresponded with a lull in the Thirty Years' War, which occurred between 1618 and 1648. Hence market prices were responding rationally to a rise in demand. However, the fall in prices was faster and more dramatic than the rise, and did not result from a sudden resurgence in the war.

郁金香合同的价格在1636-37年间急剧上升然后下降这个事实是没有争议的，但是及时事最剧烈的价格的上升和下降并不一定意味着一个经济的或者推断的泡沫发展然后爆发。对于已经被定性为经济泡沫的郁金香狂热来说，郁金香块茎的价格本应该需要是跟块茎的内部价值相错乱的。现代经济学家已经提出了几种可能的原因来解释为什么价格的上升下降没有形成一个泡沫。一方面，17世纪30年代的价格增长一个三十年的战争的停滞有关，这场战争是在1618－1648年间发生的。因此市场价格和一个理性的需求上升有关。然而，价格的下跌相比需求增长来说十分快速和剧烈，而且并不是来自于战争的忽然复苏。
