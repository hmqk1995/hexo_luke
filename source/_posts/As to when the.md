As to when the first people populated the American subcontinents is hotly debated. Until recently, the Clovis people, based on evidence found in New Mexico, were thought to have been the first to have arrived, some 13,000 years ago. Yet evidence gathered from other sites suggest the Americas had been settled at least 1,000 years prior to the Clovis. The “Clovis first” idea, nonetheless, was treated as gospel, backed by supporters who, at least initially, outright discounted any claims that suggested precedence by non-Clovis people. While such a stance smacked of fanaticism, proponents did have a solid claim: if the Clovis peoples crossed the Bering Strait 13,000 years ago, only after it had become ice-free, how would a people have been able to make a similar trip but over ice?

涉及到什么时候第一批人类在美洲次大陆繁衍的问题讨论火热。最近，Clovis人，基于在新墨西哥发现证据，被推测是第一批到达的人，这些人在13000年前到达。然而从其他据点收集到的证据显示美洲在比Clovis人早1000年就有人定居。然而，这个“Clovis第一“的观点”，被视为经典，被一些这样的支持者们：至少基本上，完全不考虑任何暗示有非discounted人提前存在的观点。尽管这样的观点有盲信的味道，支持者们确实有一个确凿的声明：如果Clovis民族在13000年前穿越了白令海峡，在这之后紧接着就是不冻期，一个民族怎么能够进行一个类似的旅程，但是是在冰上的？

A recent school of thought, backed by Weber, provides the following answer: pre-Clovis people reached the Americas by relying on a sophisticated maritime culture, which allowed them to take advantage of refugia, or small areas in which aquatic life flourished. Thus they were able to make the long journey by hugging the coast as far south as to what is today British Columbia. Additionally, they were believed to have fashioned a primitive form of crampon so that they would be able to dock in these refugia and avail themselves of the microfauna. Still, such a theory begs the question as to how such a culture developed.

一个最近的观点的学派，被Weber支持的，提供了下列答案：前Clovis人到达美洲通过依靠一个精通的海洋文化，这种文化允许他们充分利用refugia,一个水生生物茂盛的小区域。因此他们能够做一个很长的旅行通过拥抱海岸线一直到今天的英属哥伦比亚岛那里那么南端。并且，他们被认为已经流行起了一个原始的鞋底钉，这样的话他们就能够进入这样的refugia然后利用这些微生动物群。仍然，这样的学说回避了一个问题：这样的文化是如何形成的。

The Solutrean theory has been influential in answering this question, a fact that may seem paradoxical—and startling—to those familiar with its line of reasoning: the Clovis people were actually Solutreans, an ancient seafaring culture along the Iberian peninsula, who had—astoundingly given the time period—crossed into the Americas via the Atlantic ocean. Could not a similar Siberian culture, if not the pre-Clovis people themselves, have displayed equal nautical sophistication?

Solutrean学说在回答这个问题上至关重要，一个事实似乎是矛盾的——和惊人的——对于那些熟悉他的推理过程的人来说：Clovis人事实上是Solutrean人，一个古老的航海文化在Iberian半岛，这些人惊人地给出了时间周期——通过大西洋穿越进入美洲。能有一个相似的Siberian文化，如果不是前Clovis民族他们自己，展现一样的航海复杂吗？

* seafaring adj.航海的，水上的

Even if one subscribes to this line of reasoning, the “Clovis first” school still have an objection: proponents of a pre-Clovis people rely solely on the Monte Verde site in Chile, a site so far south that its location begs yet another question: What of the 6,000 miles of coastline between the ice corridor and Monte Verde? Besides remains found in a network of caves in Oregon, there has been scant evidence of a pre-Clovis people. Nonetheless, Meade and Pizinsky claim that a propitious geologic accident could account for this discrepancy: Monte Verde was located near a peat bog that essentially fossilized the village. Archaeologists uncovered two wooden stakes, which, at one time, were used in twelve huts. Furthermore, plant species associated with areas 150 miles away were found, suggesting a trade network. These findings indicate that the Clovis may not have been the first to people the Americas, yet more excavation, both in Monte Verde and along the coast, must be conducted in order to determine the extent of pre-Clovis settlements in the Americas.

即使一个人支持这种推理过程，Clovis第一的学派仍然有反对意见：前Clovis民族的支持者仅仅依靠在Chile的Monte Verde站点，这样一个站点在如此的南端以至于他的地理位置隐藏了另一个问题：在冰道和Monte Verde之间的6000英里海岸线是什么情况？除了在Oregon的一个洞穴网络中发现的残余物，关于前Clovis民族的证据一片空白。然而，M和P声称一个合适的地理事件可以解释这个矛盾：Monte Verde在一个peat bog附近，这些peat bog基础地结成了村落。考古学家发现了两个木桩，这两个木桩在同一时期被用于在十二个小屋中。更多地是，在150英里以外的于这个地区相关联的植物种类被发现，意味着一个贸易网络。这些发现证明Clovis可能不是美洲的第一批居民，然而更多的研究，同时在Monte Verde和沿岸地区，必须被执行，来确定前Clovis居民在美洲的存在。
