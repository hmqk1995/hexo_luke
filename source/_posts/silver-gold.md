The US Constitution established both gold and silver as the basis of US currency: that is to say, it established a bimetallic standard for currency. This remained in place for about a century, until the Coinage Act of 1873, which embraced a "gold only" standard, a monometallic standard, effectively dropping silver as the basis of currency. Over the next several decades, advocates of bimetallism and advocates of the "gold only" standard fiercely debated.

The "gold only" advocates, such as William McKinley, argued that shifts in the relative value of the two precious metals could lead to wild fluctuations in the values of currency in a bimetallic system. Early in the United States history, Alexander Hamilton had tried to fix the gold-silver exchange rate by fiat, but of course, such restraints only inhibit the natural development of a free market.

Unemployment was high in the depression caused by the Panic of 1893, and many argued that these economic challenges had been triggered by abandoning bimetallism. One of the more prominent advocates of bimetallism was William Jennings Bryant: indeed, bimetallism was the very center of his presidential campaigns in 1896 and 1900, both of which he lost to McKinley. Bryant articulated the popular view that a "gold only" standard limited the money supply, and thus favored those who were already quite wealthy, against the interests of working people of all professions. He famously expressed this argument in his "Cross of Gold" speech at the 1896 Democratic National Convention, in which he argued that continuing the "gold only" standard would "crucify" the honest laboring classes on a "cross of gold."

Despite the eloquence of Bryant's arguments, history strongly favored the "gold-only" standard. <b>The argument that increasing the money supply would lead to greater prosperity strikes us now as naïve</b>: of course, we now understand that increasing the monetary supply can lead to runaway inflation, which hurts everyone. Furthermore, <b>gold did not remain as limited as the advocates of bimetallism imagined</b>. In the 1890s, scientists discovered a cyanide process that allowed workers to extract pure gold from much lower grade ore, thus significantly increasing domestic gold production. Additionally, the discovery of two immense gold deposits in South Africa substantially increased world gold supply. Thus, the "gold only" standard allowed for ample currency, and even robust prosperity in the 1920s, so bimetallism died a quiet death.

美国宪法将金和银都建立为美国货币的基础：也就是说，它建立了一种复本位制的货币标准。这个标准持续了大概一个世纪，直到1873年的Coinage Act颁布，这个Act拥抱了一个只有金为标准的单金属本位标准，有效地将银从货币基础中剔除。在接下来的几个世纪里，复本位制的支持者和金本位的拥护者进行了激烈的争论。

金本位的拥护者，像William McKinley，认为在复本位制系统中，两种稀有金属的相对价值的准变可能会导致货币价值巨大的波动。在美国历史早期，Alexander Hamilton已经试图用 来固定金银交换比率，但是当然，这样的限制措施仅仅是阻碍了自由市场的自然发展。

在1893年经济恐慌引起的大萧条时期，失业率极高，许多人认为这些经济挑战就是因为禁止了复本位制而引起的。最有名的复本位制拥护者之一是William Jennings Bryant: 事实上，提倡复本位制是在他1896年和1900年的总统竞选中重要的核心，不过两次竞选都输给了McKinley。Bryant精心组织了著名的论点：一个金本位的标准会限制金钱供应，因此会对那些本来就十分富裕的人有利，而不利于所有职业的工人阶级的利益。他出名地在1896年民主党全国代表大会的“Cross of Gold”的演讲中表达了这个观点，在观点中他宣称继续金本位制将会把诚实守信的劳动阶层钉死在上帝的十字架上。

尽管Bryant的观点十分有说服力，但是历史强烈地证明金本位制度是对的。我们现在认为提高货币供应的观点将会促进经济繁荣的观点十分幼稚。当然，我们现在理解提高货币供应可能会导致失去控制的通货膨胀，这种通货膨胀伤及到每个人。更多的是，金的数量不是持续地像复本位货币制支持者想象的那样有限。在19世纪90年代，科学家发现了一个氰化物方法，能够让工人们从非常低等级的矿石中提炼中纯金，因此极大地提高了国内金的生产。另外，在南亚的两个巨大的金储库发现也极大提高了世界金的供应量。因此，“金本位”拥有了足够的货币，甚至是在20世纪20年代的最强健的繁荣时期，所以复本位制悄悄消失在了人海。
