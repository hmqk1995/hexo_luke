title: 学术界对于Olmec文明消失原因的争论
==========

Most scholarship into the sudden disappearance of the Olmec civilization 2,500 years ago has focused on the change in meteorological conditions favorable to subsistence crops. Much of this research, though, has overlooked the role that changing geography, most notably the course of rivers, played. The Coatzacoalcos River, the main river passing through La Venta, could have had notable tributaries diverted as a result of climate change, leading to not only severe flooding in certain areas, but also to a lack of sufficient water for subsistence crops planted near the erstwhile alluvial plain. Such a view, however, fails to account for the resilience of a people capable of transferring crops and moving settlements as need be. What was more likely responsible for the downfall of the Olmec civilization was internal dissent brought on by ecological change, since a leadership unable to control events was likely to be perceived as weak. Without the central governance needed to adapt crop subsistence patterns, the Olmec likely became a collection of feuding clans and thus within a few generations all but disappeared.

大部分对于Olmec文明在2500年前消失的学术研究集中于对于口粮植物的有利的气象条件的变化。尽管，这个研究的大部分都忽略了不断变化的地理条件发挥的作用，最明显的就是河道的变化。Coatzacoalcos河，穿过La Venta的主流，本能够令显著的支流被转移，作为气候变化的结果，导致了不仅在某些地区十分严重的洪灾，也导致了种植在前冲积平原的口粮植物的充足水源的缺乏。然而，这样一种观点并没有解释一个民族在需要的情况下能够有能力转移粮食作物以及改变居住地的快速恢复的能力。更有可能导致Olmec文明垮台的原因是由生态变化带来的内部意见的不一致，因为一个不能够控制大事发生的首领可能会被认为是没有能耐的。没有了被需要来适应粮食生存模式的中央政府，Olmec人很可能变成一堆长期结怨的宗族，因此没过几代便几乎都消失了。

##### Which of the following is an assumption the author of the passage makes?

1. The crops displaced by the flooding of the Coatzacoalcos River would not be viable if replanted in areas unaffected by flooding.
2. Adapting to crop subsistence involves some level of central governance.
3. Feuding clans are not capable of sustaining a viable population in the wake of ecological catastrophe.

##### 下面哪些是作者对于文段作出的假设？

1. 如果被Coatzacoalcos河的洪水取代的粮食作物被种植到没有被洪水影响的地方，这些植物是不能够生长的。
2. 适应粮食作物生存需要一些级别的中央集权。
3. 一些世仇的宗族在生态灾难的条件下不能够维持一个可持续的人口。

##### Which of the following, if true, would best undermine the theory the author of the passage provides for the sudden disappearance of the Olmec?

* Much of the flooding that resulted came not from any diverted tributaries but by rainfall that intensified over the course of a decade.
* Not all the major subsistence crops were planted along the Coatzacoalcos River.
* Internal dissent was long offered as a theory for the disappearance of the Mayans, but in recent years there is near unanimous agreement that the disappearance was mostly caused by meteorological phenomenon.
* The Olmec split into two groups that warred persistently for several decades before both succumbed to meteorological changes that made settlement of the area virtually impossible.
* The Olmec leadership successfully relocated settlements near one of the new tributaries of Coatzacoalcos, yet years of constant flooding precluded the growth of subsistence crops.
