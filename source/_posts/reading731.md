title: 关于睡眠学习实验的文章
---

> Sleep-learning experiments are notoriously difficult to conduct. For one thing, one must be sure that the subjects are actually asleep and stay that way during the "lessons." The most rigorous trials of verbal sleep learning have failed to show any new knowledge taking root. While more and more research has demonstrated the importance of sleep for learning and memory consolidation, none had managed to show actual learning of new information taking place in an adult brain during sleep.

睡眠学习实验十分难以进行。一方面，必须确保被试真正的处于睡眠状态，并且在睡眠学习的“课程”中保持这样的状态。专业术语中最严格的睡眠学习实验并没有取得任何实质性进展。尽管越来越多的研究已经证实睡眠对于学习和记忆巩固的重要性，还没有研究成功地展现在一个正在睡眠中的成年人大脑中发生的对于新信息的真实学习。

> Recently, however, researchers chose to experiment with a type of conditioning that involves exposing subjects to a tone followed by an odor, so that they soon exhibit a similar response to the tone as they would to the odor. The pairing of tones and odors presented several advantages. Neither wakes the sleeper (in fact, certain odors can promote sound sleep), yet the brain processes them and even reacts during slumber. Moreover, the sense of smell holds a unique non-verbal measure that can be observed -- namely sniffing. The researchers found that, in the case of smelling, the sleeping brain acts much as it does when awake: We inhale deeply when we smell a pleasant aroma but stop our inhalation short when assaulted by a bad smell. This variation in sniffing could be recorded whether the subjects were asleep or awake. Finally, this type of conditioning, while it may appear to be quite simple, is associated with some higher brain areas -- including the hippocampus, which is involved in memory formation.

然而，近年来，研究者们选择使用一种包含将客体暴露在一种跟随着气味的声调中的条件来做实验，因此他们展现一种对于气味和声调的相似反应。这样一组声调和气味的配对展现了一些优势。这样不会惊醒睡眠者（事实上，某些气味还能促进良好睡眠），大脑还会处理这些气味，在微睡状态还会起反应。更进一步，气味的感觉展现了一个独特的非语言的尺度，这种尺度可以被观察到——也就是嗅这个动作。研究者们发现，在闻的状态下，睡眠中的大脑的反应跟清醒中相同：当我们闻到芬芳的气味时深深地吸气，在被臭气攻击时我们短暂憋住呼吸。这种嗅的变化性，无论主题在睡眠还是清醒时，都可以被记录。最终，这种条件作用的形式，尽管似乎十分简单，也是与一些大脑中更高级别的区域相联的——包括在记忆形成中起作用的海马体。

> In the experiments, the subjects slept in a special lab while their sleep state was continuously monitored. As they slept, a tone was played, followed by an odor -- either pleasant or unpleasant. Then another tone was played, followed by an odor at the opposite end of the pleasantness scale. Over the course of the night, the associations were partially reinforced, <b>so that the subject was exposed to just the tones as well.</b> The sleeping volunteers reacted to the tones alone as if the associated odor were still present -- by either sniffing deeply or taking shallow breaths. The next day, the now awake subjects again heard the tones alone -- with no accompanying odor. Although they had no conscious recollection of listening to them during the night, their breathing patterns <b>told a different story</b>. When exposed to tones that had been paired with pleasant odors, they sniffed deeply, while the second tones -- those associated with bad smells -- provoked short, shallow sniffs.

在实验中，被试在一个特定的实验室中睡眠，他们的睡眠状态被持续监测。在他们睡觉的时候，一种声调被播放，伴随着一种气味——好闻的或者是难闻的。之后另一种声调被播放，跟随者一种在芳香尺度上对立的另一头的气味。在整夜的过程中，这种联系呗部分加强，最后被试被暴露在仅仅只有声调中。这些睡眠志愿者们对于单独声调的反应好像这种气味的联系仍然存在，通过或是深嗅，或是浅呼吸。第二天，这些现在清醒的被试再一次单独听到声调——没有伴随的气味。尽管他们没有夜晚曾经听到过这些声调的有意识记忆，但是他们的呼吸模式则是另一码事。当暴露在之前已经与芳香气味相连的声调中时，他们深呼吸，同时第二种声调—与难闻气味相连的—则激起了短暂和浅的嗅。

> The team then asked whether this type of learning is tied to a particular phase of sleep. In a second experiment, they divided the sleep cycles into rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep, and then induced the conditioning during only one phase or the other. Surprisingly, they found that the learned response was more pronounced during the REM phase, but the transfer of the association from sleep to waking was evident only when learning took place during the non-REM phase. The researchers suggest that during REM sleep we may be more open to influence from the stimuli in our surroundings, but so-called "dream amnesia" -- which makes us forget most of our dreams -- may operate on any conditioning occurring in that stage of sleep. In contrast, non-REM sleep is the phase that is important for memory consolidation, so it might also play a role in this form of sleep-learning.


这个工作组之后探寻了是否这种学习模式与一种睡眠的特定周期有关。在第二次试验中，他们把睡眠周期分为REM（快速眼动）睡眠和非REM睡眠，之后只在在其中一个睡眠阶段引起实验。惊奇地是，他们发现学习反应在REM阶段更加显著，但是这种从睡眠到清醒的联系的转变只有当学习发生在非REM睡眠的时候最为明显。这些研究者们表明在REM睡眠阶段我们可能更容易被周围的刺激所影响，但是被称为“睡眠遗忘”——这种使我们忘记大部分做过的梦——可能在那个睡眠阶段的任何条件发生时产生作用。与之对比的是，非REM睡眠是对于记忆巩固十分重要的睡眠阶段，因此它可能在这种睡眠学习的形成起作用。
