title: environmental regulations 环境法规
=====
Compared to regulations in other countries, those of the United States tend to be narrower in scope, with an emphasis on manufacturing processes and specific categories of pollution, and little or no attention to the many other factors that affect environmental quality. An example is the focus on controlling pollution rather than influencing decisions about processes, raw materials, or products that determine environmental impacts. Regulation in the United States tends to isolate specific aspects of production processes and attempts to control them stringently, which means that some aspects of business are regulated tightly, although sometimes not cost-effectively, while others are ignored. <b>Other countries and several American states have recently made more progress in preventing pollution at its source and considering such issues as product life cycles, packaging waste, and industrial energy efficiency.</b>

与其他国家的法规相比，美国的法规趋向于在视野上更加狭窄，主要强调生产过程和特定的排放种类，基本没有关注过许多其他影响环境质量的方面。一个例子就是对控制污染的关注而不是关注对于过程的影响性的决定，原材料，或者是决定环境影响的产品。美国的法规趋向于将生产过程的特定方面孤立起来，并试图严格控制他们而忽略其他方面。这种行为意味着这个过程的某些方面被严格管束，尽管有时候没有成本收益。其他国家和一些美国的州近期在从源头以及从产品生命周期、包装浪费和工业能源效能的角度思考来阻止污染方面有所进步。

* stringent  adj.严格的；迫切的；（货币）紧缩的
* cost-effectively adj.有成本效益的，划算的；合算的（等于cost-efficient）

Environmental regulation in the United States is also more prescriptive than elsewhere, in the sense of requiring specific actions, with little discretion left to the regulated firm. There also is a great reliance on action-forcing laws and technology standards.

在美国的环境法规也比其他地方更有规定性，在要求更精确的行动的指导下，基本没有给被监管的公司留下决定自由。对于迫使行动的法律和技术标准也有一个很大的依赖。

=======
* prescriptive adj.规定的； 指定的；约定俗成的； 惯例的
* discretion n.慎重；考虑周到；判断力，辨别力；自行决定的自由

These contrasts are illustrated nicely in a 1974 book that used a hare and tortoise analogy to compare air quality regulation in the United States and Sweden. While the United States (the hare) codified ambitious goals in statutes that drove industry to adopt new technologies under the threat of sanctions, Sweden (the tortoise) used a more collaborative process that stressed results but worked with industry in deciding how to achieve them. In the end air quality results were about the same. Similar results have been found in other comparative analyses of environmental regulation. For example, one study of a multinational firm with operations in the United States and Japan found that pollution levels in both countries were similar, despite generally higher pollution abatement expenditures in the United States. <b>The higher costs observed in the United States thus were due in large part, not to more stringent standards, but to the higher regulatory transaction costs.</b> Because agencies in different countries share information about technologies, best practices, and other issues, the pollution levels found acceptable in different countries tends to be quite similar.

这些比较在一本1974年的书中被很好的描述，这本书使用一个野兔和乌龟的类比来比较在美国和瑞典的空气质量法规。美国（野兔）将宏大的计划编纂进法规中，这些法规通过罚款的威胁来驱动工业来采纳新技术。瑞典（乌龟）使用一个更佳合作的过程，这个过程强调结果但是在决定怎样达成他们的方面和工业部门一起讨论。最终空气质量结果基本相同。相似的结果在其他环境法规的对比性分析中也能得出。例如，一个关于在美国和日本的跨国公司的运作的研究中发现，污染指数在两个国家基本相似，尽管在美国有答题更高的污染削减支出。在美国观察到的更高支出因此就在很大部分地归因于更高的监管性的交易费用，而不是更严格的标准。因为在不同国家的机构分享技术的相同信息，最佳实践和其他问题，所以在不同国家的可接受的发现污染级别趋向于一致。

##### The author of the passage would disagree with which of the following?

* Some nations are likely to put more focus on regulating industry than allowing industry a measure of autonomy.
* Varying levels of regulation often lead to similar levels of pollution.
* There is a complete lack of transparency in the different standards used by countries.
* The United States tends to regulate only a few aspects of the overall production process.
* Analogies can aptly summarize the primary differences between the environmental practices of two countries.

Keys: 3. 文末提到agencies in different countries share information about technologies, best practices, and other issues|不同国家的机构分享技术的相同信息，最佳实践和其他问题，表明国家间技术标准透明分享，这是作者认同的观点，因此第三个选项a complete lack of transparency|缺乏透明性与作者观点相反。
